<h1><big>JOHN JONES'S DOLLAR</big></h1>

<h2>By HARRY STEPHEN KEELER</h2>

<p class="p1"><i>Take a board with 64 squares on it. Put a grain of wheat
on the first square&mdash;two on the second&mdash;four on the third.
Keep doubling in this manner and you will find there
isn't enough wheat in the world to fill the sixty-fourth
square. It can be the same with compound interest.</i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">On the</span> 201st day of the year
3221 A.D., the professor of
history at the University of
Terra seated himself in front
of the Visaphone and prepared
to deliver the daily lecture to his
class, the members of which resided
in different portions of the
earth.</p>

<p>The instrument before which
he seated himself was very like
a great window sash, on account
of the fact that there were three
or four hundred frosted glass
squares visible. In a space at the
center, not occupied by any of
these glass squares, was a dark
oblong area and a ledge holding
a piece of chalk. And above the
area was a huge brass cylinder;
toward this brass cylinder the
professor would soon direct his
subsequent remarks.</p>

<p>In order to assure himself
that it was time to press the button
which would notify the members
of the class in history to approach
their local Visaphones,
the professor withdrew from his
vest pocket a small contrivance
which he held to his ear. Upon
moving a tiny switch attached
to the instrument, a metallic
voice, seeming to come from
somewhere in space, repeated
mechanically: "Fifteen o'clock
and one minute&mdash;fifteen o'clock
and one minute&mdash;fifteen o'clock
and one min&mdash;" Quickly, the
professor replaced the instrument
in his vest pocket and
pressed a button at the side of
the Visaphone.</p>

<p>As though in answer to the
summons, the frosted squares
began, one by one, to show the
faces and shoulders of a peculiar
type of young men; young men
with great bulging foreheads,
bald, toothless, and wearing immense
horn spectacles. One
square, however, still remained
empty. On noticing this, a look
of irritation passed over the professor's
countenance.</p>

<p>But, seeing that every other
glass square but this one was
filled up, he commenced to talk.</p>

<p>"I am pleased, gentlemen, to
see you all posted at your local
Visaphones this afternoon. I
have prepared my lecture today
upon a subject which is, perhaps,
of more economic interest
than historical. Unlike the previous
lectures, my talk will not
confine itself to the happenings
of a few years, but will gradually
embrace the course of ten
centuries, the ten centuries, in
fact, which terminated three
hundred years before the present
date. My lecture will be an
exposition of the effects of the
John Jones Dollar, originally deposited
in the dawn of civilization,
or to be more precise, in the
year of 1921&mdash;just thirteen hundred
years ago. This John
Jon&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point in the professor's
lecture, the frosted glass
square which hitherto had shown
no image, now filled up. Sternly
he gazed at the head and shoulders
that had just appeared.</p>

<p>"B262H72476Male, you are
late to class again. What excuse
have you to offer today?"</p>

<p>From the hollow cylinder emanated
a shrill voice, while the
lips of the picture on the glass
square moved in unison with the
words:</p>

<p>"Professor, you will perceive
by consulting your class book,
that I have recently taken up
my residence near the North
Pole. For some reason, wireless
communication between the Central
Energy Station and all
points north of 89 degrees was
cut off a while ago, on account
of which fact I could not appear
in the Visaphone. Hence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough, sir," roared the professor.
"Always ready with an
excuse, B262H72476Male. I shall
immediately investigate your
tale."</p>

<p>From his coat pocket, the professor
withdrew an instrument
which, although supplied with an
earpiece and a mouthpiece, had
no wires whatever attached.
Raising it to his lips, he spoke:</p>

<p>"Hello. Central Energy Station,
please." A pause ensued.
"Central Energy Station? This is
the professor of history at the
University of Terra, speaking.
One of my students informs me
that the North Pole region was
out of communication with the
Visaphone System this morning.
Is that statement true? I
would&mdash;"</p>

<p>A voice, apparently from nowhere,
spoke into the professor's
ear. "Quite true, Professor. A
train of our ether waves accidently
fell into parallelism with
a train of waves from the Venus
Substation. By the most peculiar
mischance, the two trains happened
to be displaced, with reference
to each other, one half
of a wave length, with the unfortunate
result that the negative
points of one coincided with the
positive points of maximum amplitude
of the other. Hence the
two wave trains nullified each
other and communication ceased
for one hundred and eighty-five
seconds&mdash;until the earth had revolved
far enough to throw them
out of parallelism."</p>

<p>"Ah! Thank you," replied the
professor. He dropped his instrument
into his coat pocket
and gazed in the direction of the
glass square whose image had
so aroused his ire. "I apologize,
B262H72476Male, for my suspicions
as to your veracity&mdash;but I
had in mind several former experiences."
He shook a warning
forefinger. "I will now resume
my talk."</p>

<p>"A moment ago, gentlemen, I
mentioned the John Jones Dollar.
Some of you who have just
enrolled with the class will undoubtedly
say to yourselves:
'What is a John Jones? What is
a Dollar?'</p>

<p>"In the early days, before the
present scientific registration of
human beings was instituted by
the National Eugenics Society,
man went around under a crude
multi-reduplicative system of
nomenclature. Under this system
there were actually more John
Joneses than there are calories
in a British Thermal Unit. But
there was one John Jones, in
particular, living in the twentieth
century, to whom I shall
refer in my lecture. Not much is
known of his personal life except
that he was an ardent socialist&mdash;a
bitter enemy, in fact, of the
private ownership of wealth.</p>

<p>"Now as to the Dollar. At this
day, when the Psycho-Erg, a
combination of the Psych, the
unit of esthetic satisfaction, and
the Erg, the unit of mechanical
energy, is recognized as the
true unit of value, it seems
difficult to believe that in the
twentieth century and for more
than ten centuries thereafter,
the Dollar, a metallic circular
disk, was being passed from
hand to hand in exchange for
the essentials of life.</p>

<p>"But nevertheless, such was
the case. Man exchanged his
mental or physical energy for
these Dollars. He then re-exchanged
the Dollars for sustenance,
raiment, pleasure, and
operations for the removal of the
vermiform appendix.</p>

<p>"A great many individuals,
however, deposited their Dollars
in a stronghold called a bank.
These banks invested the Dollars
in loans and commercial enterprises,
with the result that, every
time the earth traversed the
solar ecliptic, the banks compelled
each borrower to repay, or
to acknowledge as due, the original
loan, plus six one-hundredths
of that loan. And to the
depositor, the banks paid three
one-hundredths of the deposited
Dollars for the use of the disks.
This was known as three percent,
or bank interest.</p>

<p>"Now, the safety of Dollars,
when deposited in banks, was not
absolutely assured to the depositor.
At times, the custodians
of these Dollars were wont to
appropriate them and proceed to
portions of the earth, sparsely
inhabited and accessible with
difficulty. And at other times,
nomadic groups known as 'yeggmen'
visited the banks, opened
the vaults by force, and departed,
carrying with them the contents.</p>

<p>"But to return to our subject.
In the year 1921, one of these
numerous John Joneses performed
an apparently inconsequential
action which caused the name of
John Jones to go down in history.
What did he do?</p>

<p>"He proceeded to one of these
banks, known at that time as
'The First National Bank of
Chicago,' and deposited there,
one of these disks&mdash;a silver Dollar&mdash;to
the credit of a certain
individual. And this individual
to whose credit the Dollar was
deposited was no other person
than the fortieth descendant of
John Jones who stipulated in
paper which was placed in the
files of the bank, that the descendancy
was to take place
along the oldest child of each of
the generations which would
constitute his posterity.</p>

<p>"The bank accepted the Dollar
under that understanding, together
with another condition
imposed by this John Jones,
namely, that the interest was to
be compounded annually. That
meant that at the close of each
year, the bank was to credit the
account of John Jones's fortieth
descendant with three one-hundredths
of the account as it stood
at the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>"History tells us little more
concerning this John Jones&mdash;only
that he died in the year
1931, or ten years afterward,
leaving several children.</p>

<p>"Now you gentlemen who are
taking mathematics under Professor
L127M72421Male, of the
University of Mars, will remember
that where any number such
as X, in passing through a progressive
cycle of change, grows
at the end of that cycle by a proportion
p, then the value of the
original X, after n cycles, becomes
X(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;p)<sup>n</sup>.</p>

<p>"Obviously, in this case, X
equalled one Dollar; p equalled
three one-hundredths; and n will
depend upon any number of
years which we care to consider,
following the date of deposit. By
a simple calculation, those of
you who are today mentally alert
can check up the results that I
shall set forth in my lecture.</p>

<p>"At the time that John Jones
died, the amount in the First
National Bank of Chicago to the
credit of John Jones the fortieth,
was as follows."</p>

<p>The professor seized the chalk
and wrote rapidly upon the oblong
space:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td1">1931</td><td class="td2">10 years elapsed</td><td class="td2">$1.34</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"The peculiar sinuous hieroglyphic,"
he explained, "is an
ideograph representing the Dollar.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, time went on
as time will, until a hundred
years had passed by. The First
National Bank still existed, and
the locality, Chicago, had become
the largest center of population
upon the earth. Through the investments
which had taken place,
and the yearly compounding of
interest, the status of John
Jones's deposit was now as follows."
He wrote:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td1">2021</td><td class="td2">100 years elapsed</td><td class="td2">$19.10</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"In the following century,
many minor changes, of course,
took place in man's mode of living;
but the so-called socialists
still agitated widely for the cessation
of private ownership of
wealth; the First National Bank
still accepted Dollars for safe
keeping, and the John Jones
Dollar still continued to grow.
With about thirty-four generations
yet to come, the account
now stood:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td1">2121</td><td class="td2">200 years elapsed</td><td class="td2">$364</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"And by the end of the succeeding
hundred years, it had
grown to what constituted an
appreciable bit of exchange value
in those days&mdash;thus:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td1">2221</td><td class="td2">300 years</td><td class="td2">$6,920</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"Now the century which followed
contains an important
date. The date I am referring to
is the year 2299 A.D., or the year
in which every human being
born upon the globe was registered
under a numerical name at
the central bureau of the National
Eugenics Society. In our
future lessons which will treat
with that period of detail, I
shall ask you to memorize that
date.</p>

<p>"The socialists still agitated,
fruitlessly, but the First National
Bank of Chicago was now
the first International Bank of
the Earth. And how great had
John Jones's Dollar grown? Let
us examine the account, both on
that important historical date,
and also at the close of the 400th
year since it was deposited.
Look:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td1">2299<br />2321</td><td class="td2">378 years<br />400 years</td><td class="td2">$68,900<br />$132,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"But gentlemen, it had not
reached the point where it could
be termed an unusually large accumulation
of wealth. For larger
accumulations existed upon the
earth. A descendant of a man
once known as John D. Rockefeller
possessed an accumulation of
great size, but which, as a matter
of fact, was rapidly dwindling
as it passed from generation
to generation. So, let us
travel ahead another one hundred
years. During this time, as
we learn from our historical and
political archives, the socialists
began to die out, since they at
last realized the utter futility of
combating the balance of power.
The account, though, now stood:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td1">2421</td><td class="td2">500 years</td><td class="td2">$2,520,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"It is hardly necessary for me
to make any comment. Those of
you who are most astute, and
others of you who flunked my
course before and are now taking
it the second time, of course
know what is coming.</p>

<p>"During the age in which this
John Jones lived, there lived also
a man, a so-called scientist called
Metchnikoff. We know, from a
study of our vast collection of
Egyptian Papyri and Carnegie
Library books, that this Metchnikoff
promulgated the theory
that old age&mdash;or rather senility&mdash;was
caused by colon-bacillus.
This fact was later verified. But
while he was correct in the etiology
of senility, he was crudely
primeval in the therapeutics of
it.</p>

<p>"He proposed, gentlemen, to
combat and kill this bacillus by
utilizing the fermented lacteal
fluid from a now extinct animal
called the cow, models of which
you can see at any time at the
Solaris Museum."</p>

<p>A chorus of shrill, piping
laughter emanated from the
brass cylinder. The professor
waited until the merriment had
subsided and then continued:</p>

<p>"I beg of you, gentlemen, do
not smile. This was merely one
of the many similar quaint
superstitions existing in that
age.</p>

<p>"But a real scientist, Professor
K122B62411Male, again attacked
the problem in the
twenty-fifth century. Since the
cow was now extinct, he could
not waste his valuable time experimenting
with fermented cow
lacteal fluid. He discovered the
old <i>v</i>-rays of Radium&mdash;the rays
which you physicists will remember
are not deflected by a
magnetic field&mdash;were really composed
of two sets of rays, which
he termed the <i>g</i> rays and the <i>e</i>
rays. These last named rays&mdash;only
when isolated&mdash;completely
devitalized all colon-bacilli which
lay in their path, without in the
least affecting the integrity of
any interposed organic cells. The
great result, as many of you already
know, was that the life of
man was extended to nearly two
hundred years. That, I state unequivocally,
was a great century
for the human race.</p>

<hr />

<p>"But I spoke of another happening&mdash;one,
perhaps, of more
interest than importance. I referred
to the bank account of
John Jones the fortieth. It,
gentlemen, had grown to such
a prodigious sum that a special
bank and board of directors had
to be created in order to care
for, and reinvest it. By scanning
the following notation, you will
perceive the truth of my statement:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td1">2521</td><td class="td2">600 years</td><td class="td2">$47,900,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"By the year 2621 A.D., two
events of stupendous importance
took place. There is scarcely a
man in this class who has not
heard of how Professor P222D29333Male
accidentally stumbled
upon the scientific fact
that the effect of gravity is reversed
upon any body which vibrates
perpendicularly to the
plane of the ecliptic with a frequency
which is an even multiple
of the logarithm of 2 of the
Naperian base 'e.' At once, special
vibrating cars were constructed
which carried mankind
to all planets. That discovery of
Professor P222D29333Male did
nothing less than open up seven
new territories to our inhabitants;
namely: Mercury, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
and Neptune. In the great land
rush that ensued, thousands who
were previously poor became
rich.</p>

<p>"But, gentlemen, land which
so far had been constituted one
of the main sources of wealth,
was shortly to become valuable
for individual golf links only, as
it is today, on account of another
scientific discovery.</p>

<p>"This second discovery was in
reality, not a discovery, but the
perfection of a chemical process,
the principles of which had been
known for many centuries. I am
alluding to the construction of
the vast reducing factories, one
upon each planet, to which the
bodies of all persons who have
died on their respective planets
are at once shipped by Aerial
Express. Since this process is
used today, all of you understand
the methods employed;
how each body is reduced by heat
to its component constituents:
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon,
calcium, phosphorus, and so
forth; how these separated constituents
are stored in special
reservoirs together with the
components from thousands of
other corpses; how these elements
are then synthetically combined
into food tablets for those
of us who are yet alive&mdash;thus
completing an endless chain
from the dead to the living. Naturally
then, agriculture and
stock-raising ceased, since the
food problem, with which man
had coped from time immemorial,
was solved. The two direct
results were, first&mdash;that land lost
the inflated values it had possessed
when it was necessary for
tillage, and second&mdash;that men
were at last given enough leisure
to enter the fields of science and
art.</p>

<p>"And as to the John Jones Dollar,
which now embraced countless
industries and vast territory
on the earth, it stood, in value:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td1">2621</td><td class="td2">700 years</td><td class="td2">$912,000,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"In truth, gentlemen, it now
constituted the largest private
fortune on the terrestrial globe.
And in that year, 2621 A.D.,
there were thirteen generations
yet to come, before John Jones
the fortieth would arrive.</p>

<p>"To continue. In the year
2721 A.D., an important political
battle was concluded in the Solar
System Senate and House of
Representatives. I am referring
to the great controversy as to
whether the Earth's moon was
a sufficient menace to interplanetary
navigation to warrant its
removal. The outcome of the
wrangle was that the question
was decided in the affirmative.
Consequently&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I beg your pardon, young
men. I occasionally lose sight of
the fact that you are not so well
informed upon historical matters
as myself. Here I am, talking to
you about the moon, totally forgetful
that many of you are puzzled
as to my meaning. I advise
all of you who have not yet attended
the Solaris Museum on
Jupiter, to take a trip there some
Sunday afternoon. The Interplanetary
Suburban Line runs
trains every half hour on that
day. You will find there a complete
working model of the old
satellite of the Earth, which,
before it was destroyed, furnished
this planet light at night
through the crude medium of reflection.</p>

<p>"On account of this decision
as to the inadvisability of allowing
the moon to remain where it
was, engineers commenced its
removal in the year 2721. Piece
by piece, it was chipped away
and brought to the Earth in Interplanetary
freight cars. These
pieces were then propelled by
Zoodolite explosive, in the direction
of the Milky Way, with a
velocity of 11,217 meters per
second. This velocity, of course,
gave each departing fragment
exactly the amount of kinetic
energy it required to enable it to
overcome the backward pull of
the Earth from here to infinity.
I dare say those moon-hunks are
going yet.</p>

<p>"At the start of the removal
of the moon in 2721 A.D., the
accumulated wealth of John
Jones the fortieth, stood:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td1">2721</td><td class="td2">800 years</td><td class="td2">$17,400,000,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"Of course, with such a colossal
sum at their command, the
directors of the fund had made
extensive investments on Mars
and Venus.</p>

<p>"By the end of the twenty-eighth
century, or the year 2807
A.D., the moon had been completely
hacked away and sent
piecemeal into space, the job
having required 86 years. I give,
herewith, the result of John
Jones's Dollar, both at the date
when the moon was completely
removed and also at the close of
the 900th year after its deposit:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td1">2807<br />2821</td><td class="td2">886 years<br />900 years</td><td class="td2">$219,000,000,000<br />$332,000,000,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"The meaning of those figures,
gentlemen, as stated in simple
language, was that the John
Jones Dollar now comprised
practically all the wealth on
Earth, Mars, and Venus&mdash;with
the exception of one university
site on each planet, which was,
of course, school property.</p>

<p>"And now I will ask you to
advance with me to the year
2906 A.D. In this year the directors
of the John Jones fund
awoke to the fact that they were
in a dreadful predicament. According
to the agreement under
which John Jones deposited his
Dollar away back in the year
1921, interest was to be compounded
annually at three percent.
In the year 2900 A.D., the
thirty-ninth generation of John
Jones was alive, being represented
by a gentleman named
J664M42721Male, who was thirty
years of age and engaged
to be married to a young lady
named T246M42652Female.</p>

<p>"Doubtless, you will ask, what
was the predicament in which
the directors found themselves.
Simply this:</p>

<p>"A careful appraisement of
the wealth on Neptune, Uranus,
Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus,
and Mercury, and likewise
Earth, together with an accurate
calculation of the remaining heat
in the Sun and an appraisement
of that heat at a very decent
valuation per calorie, demonstrated
that the total wealth
of the Solar System amounted
to $6,309,525,241,362.15.</p>

<p>"But unfortunately, a simple
computation showed that if Mr.
J664M42721Male married Miss
T246M42652Female, and was
blessed by a child by the year
2921, which year marked the
thousandth year since the deposit
of the John Jones Dollar,
then in that year there would be
due the child, the following
amount:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td1">2921</td><td class="td2">1,000 years</td><td class="td2">$6,310,000,000,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"It simply showed beyond all
possibility of argument, that by
2921 A.D., we would be $474,758,637.85
shy&mdash;that we would
be unable to meet the debt to
John Jones the fortieth.</p>

<p>"I tell you, gentlemen, the
Board of Directors was frantic.
Such wild suggestions were put
forth as the sending of an expeditionary
force to the nearest
star in order to capture some
other Solar System and thus obtain
more territory to make up
the deficit. But that project was
impossible on account of the
number of years that it would
have required.</p>

<p>"Visions of immense law suits
disturbed the slumber of those
unfortunate individuals who
formed the John Jones Dollar
Directorship. But on the brink
of one of the biggest civil actions
the courts had ever known, something
occurred that altered
everything."</p>

<p>The professor again withdrew
the tiny instrument from his
vest pocket, held it to his ear and
adjusted the switch. A metallic
voice rasped: "Fifteen o'clock
and fifty-two minutes&mdash;fifteen
o'clock and fifty-two minutes&mdash;fift&mdash;"
He replaced the instrument
and went on with his talk.</p>

<p>"I must hasten to the conclusion
of my lecture, gentlemen, as
I have an engagement with Professor
C122B24999Male of the
University of Saturn at sixteen
o'clock. Now, let me see; I was
discussing the big civil action
that was hanging over the heads
of the John Jones Dollar directors.</p>

<p>"Well, this Mr. J664M42721Male,
the thirty-ninth descendant
of the original John Jones,
had a lover's quarrel with Miss
T246M42652Female, which immediately
